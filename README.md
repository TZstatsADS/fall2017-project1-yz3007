### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: Who is the president that give away most negative emotion during inaugural speech?
+ This project is conducted by Yufei Zhao

+ Project summary: 
By exploring the texts of U. S. presidents' inaugural speeches, from that of George Washington to that of Donald Trump, there is an interesting fluctuation among the positive rates among 58 total inaugural speech. Unfortunaelt, the speeches given by President Lincoln were top two. Hence President Lincoln is the president who give away most negative emotion during inaugural speech period without any doubt. By analyzing thoroughly his two inaugural speeches, I find that the whole point of his speeches are advocating for abolishing the slavery, strengthening the power of nation, establishing advanced social mechanism for economic development. In addition, we can see that he personally hated war and thought it as a woe that destroyed the infrastructure, splited families, and broke up whole nation.
